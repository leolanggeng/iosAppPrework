**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Leonardo Langgeng**

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [v] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [v] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [v] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [v] Tip percentage slider so user can enter custom tip percentage, ranging from 10-30%
- [v] Bill splitting calculation

## Notes

For some reason, adding a second Text Field crashes the code, which is a bummer as I initially going to implement custom tip by typing percentage amount and
calculate tip by total paid(some people round the total paid so it is to make sure they give enough tip)
